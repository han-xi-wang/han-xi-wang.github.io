								<h3>Ruralizing Urbanisation: <br>Homesteads, Subjectivities, and Subversions within China's Growing Cities</h3>
								<h6><a>UKRI ESRC Funded PhD Research</a> at <a>University College London</a><br><a>Master's Dissertation</a> at <a>School of Geography and the Environment<br><br></a>Presented at the <a>2022 Royal Geographical Society Annual International Conference</a><br><br></a> Exhibited at <a>Cornell University Department of Architecture, Art, and Planning<br><br></a>Within China’s rapid urbanisation, chengshi kaihuang (translated as “urban homesteading”), an informal practice of vegetable gardening emerging from <a href="secondproject.html">China’s urban wastelands</a>, has been quietly ruralising the newly constructed urban landscape. As such, urban homesteading challenges both the dominant conceptual separation between the rural and the urban, and the assumption of the passive and powerless Chinese citizen within understandings of contemporary China. Through a mixed method study combining digital discourse analysis and semi-structured interviews, this dissertation contributes original research on the complex subjectivity of the urban homesteader within Chinese society and the ambiguous and entangled relationship between citizen agency and the authoritarian control within China’s urban environment. Within emerging discourse on urban futures steeped in crisis and dominated by top-down actions, this study contributes an understanding alternative to Eurocentric conceptions of the “right to the city” where resistance exists, not through radical opposition to, but ambiguous entanglements with structures of power.</h6>

										Water is an essential for growing vegetables. Rivers and lakes are therefore favorable sites for urban homesteaders to establish their vegetable gardens. Apart from those that are beautified to become tourist attractions, riverbanks and lakesides are often urban fringe sites that have less surveillance and control. The development of waterfront residential neighborhoods have also encouraged the appropriation of such fringe spaces for homesteading and cultivation.

										Motorways and railways are the first signs of urbanization. The tendrils of concrete and steel cut ruthlessly through existing rural land to lay the foundations for manpower and reallocation of resources necessary for further demolition and construction to take place. Ironically, the strips of land along/under major transportation infrastructures are also one of the most appropriated spaces for urban homesteaders. As rural farmlands disappear into high-rise towers, pockets of homestead emerge, again and again, in the shadows of the infrastructures that caused this change, protected by their inhabitability - noise, speed, neglect.

											<a>VACANT DEVELOPMENT</a>
											<img src="images/project1/full/Site-13-dwg.gif" alt="" />
										</div>
										As the process of urbanization began en masse, many developers believed that land prices could only go up and bought up rural land at the fringes of urban areas even without the funds necessary for development. The speculation of land and the recent scandals in the real estate sector has left many vacant sites and abandoned building sites around the city. It is typical for a residential development to have successfully completed Phase 1 or 2 but found itself out of money to build the subsequent phases planned for lots next door - leaving the newly settled urban residents with abundant wastelands to reclaim and cultivate for their family.
