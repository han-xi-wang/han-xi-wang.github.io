									<h6 class="major">Born and raised in Tianjin, China, I am an architect, designer, and <a href="https://ubel-dtp.ac.uk/esrc-studentships/">ESRC-funded PhD researcher</a> in urban geography. Currently, I am serving as <a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/people/hanxi-wang">Design Teaching Fellow</a> at the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, Cornell University. In both my research and design work, I have been invested in questioning the dominant narratives of power within the urban environment to discover the agency, resiliency, and importance of informal spatial practices by people and communities who are assumed to be passive and powerless. My current research <a href="firstproject.html">Ruralizing Urban Wastelands — Homesteads and Subversive Metabolisms in China's Growing Cities</a>, presented at the <a href="https://www.rgs.org/research/annual-international-conference/">2022 Royal Geographical Society Annual International Conference</a> in Newcastle, UK, investigates the subversive influence of displaced farmers in the wastelands of China's rapid urbanization and the complex, sometimes paradoxical ways in which they negotiate, adopt, or subvert top-down structures of governance to create alternative urban futures. <br><br>
							         I hold a B.Arch. from Cornell University and an M.Sc. with distinction in Nature, Society and Environmental Governance from the University of Oxford. I am an licensed architect in the state of New York with more than 3 years of cumulative international practice experience at leading design firms and a LEED accredited professional in sustainable design.</h6>

									<p>This project looks at damaged spaces as an unique opportunity for the spatial assertion of fringe identities into the community. At the material level, damaged spaces represent a financial liability for years before demolition, and a huge generator of waste during it. The vast amounts of recyclable/reusable materials are not salvaged due to cost of labor and time it would entail. This project proposes a gradual disintegration of a ruined slaughterhouse in Skive by 3 fringe identities within the town (identified by anthropologist Richard Jenkins) from the time of its ruin 2008. The disintegration not only yields value and sustainability in the reclaimed materials but also temporary spaces for each group’s rituals and activities: a win-win situation where an empty urban blight may come to serve as a vibrant evolving public space for the community.</p>

									<p>The industrial canals are one of the most damaging elements in the Louisiana wetlands, this is because the canals with their unnaturally straight geometry essentially create shortcuts in the landscape that bypass the pre-existing environmental balance: the shortcuts allow nutrients from the Mississippi river to escape without deposition and accumulate in the gulf, while at the same time allowing storm surges to reach inland much faster and with much greater force than it would have naturally. Thus it has severe implications on a wide range of environmental issues such as rapid land loss, saltwater intrusion, habitat loss, nurtient depletion, wetland subsidence and eutrophycation.</p>

									<p>Designed with 3 types of units, fabricated from 213 PETG components, this experimental pavilion attempts to explore the ability of thermoforming to program memory, elasticity and therefore strength into sheet plastic to construct a 8’ tall pavilion. We discovered that with a simple operation of embedding an one-directional curvature into sheet plastic, the yielding material becomes elastic in one direction and rigid in the other. While rigidity gave us the structural integrity we needed, the elasticity gave the structure an animation and flexibility that contributed to its overall stability. The doubly-curved surfaces control the micro behavior of each module while the combination of the modules control the macro behavior of the pavilion. </p>
