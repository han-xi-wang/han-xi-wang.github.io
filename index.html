									<b style="font-weight: 400">College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, Cornell University</b><br><b style="font-weight: 200; text-align: justify">There is a story that seem to emerge time and time again within contemporary narratives of crises - where severe lack and severe excess exist paradoxically at the same time. Waste, one of the most dire issues of our time, is marked by this paradox. From food deserts to homelessness, crises of waste frequently originate from the inequitable distribution of resources rooted in underlying social prejudice and discrimination. This dissertation examines the entanglements between three parallel crises, <b>urban dereliction, immigration, and landfill</b>, in a small town called Skive in Mid Jutland, Denmark and proposes <b>an alternative model of urban agency and spacemaking</b> that may modulate the existing entanglements between these three issues from vicious to virtuous. <br><br> </b>

									<p><b>College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, Cornell University</b><br>Combining the hidden monumental infrastructural spaces of a NYC Subway ventilation tower with the public intimate human-scaled spaces of a library, this project examines the potential of architectural form to create ephemeral synergies and haptic connections between apparently polarising inhabitations. The movement of air within the ventilation shaft is both monumental and banal, it is a process and an event that cannot be witnessed or experienced by the public and yet our everyday life cannot function without its existence. The building is conceived as a porous masonry mass through which air can be exchanged between the subterranean and aboveground. The curvaceous shafts are formed not only for the flow of air but also for the diffusion of light. The apparently solid and secretive mass is in fact light and generous.</p>
