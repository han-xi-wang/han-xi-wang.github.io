								<p>As the world moves rapidly towards urbanisation, the locus of urban growth is shifting away from the global north towards developing countries in Asia and Africa. This shift in geography, culture, social and political systems, in combination with the unprecedented speed of the urbanisation process occurring within these regions, have in many cases created a different urban reality than the Eurocentric vision of modernity. This study analyses the temporal and spatial dynamics of one such divergence found in China’s rapidly urbanising landscape - a phenomenon called chengshi kaihuang (urban homesteading).<br><br> A practice of informal vegetable gardening that emerges from urban wastelands, urban homesteading has been quietly ruralising China’s newly constructed urban landscape. As such, it challenges both the Eurocentric separation between the rural and the urban, and the assumption of the passive and powerless Chinese citizen within understandings of contemporary China.<br><br>Taking Wuhan as the study area, this paper leverages Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7,8 data in conjunction with 10m resolution land use/land cover products from the Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC), European Space Agency (ESA), and Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), to study the spatial, temporal, and ecological dynamics of urban homesteading within the urban environment. Through supervised land cover classification, the study shows that urban homesteading is a significant urban phenomenon that makes up approximately 5% of the land area of Wuhan’s urban centre. The results of the NDBI and BSI spectral analyses support a positive correlation between the emergence of urban homesteads with that of rapid urbanisation and urban wastelands, while the NDVI spectral analysis indicates that urban homestead’s contribution of biomass to the urban environment equals if not exceeds that of formal landscaped areas. <br><br>As urban homesteading has been almost entirely overlooked within academic research, this paper constitutes one of the first in-depth studies of the phenomenon of urban homesteading, and likely the first to leverage remote sensing data analyses.</p>
